**My Request**
<!--
Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

When you're ready and have your topic topic, please provide the following
- company name
- a title 
- brief outline of topic you are going to cover.

First up, your Title. Keep it short but make sure it really captures what your talk is about. 

Then, move on to the Description. Here, you want a short paragraph that gets into the meat of your topic. 

Mention the problem you're tackling, how you're approaching it differently, and the kind of impact or new insights attendees can expect.

Next, youâ€™ll want to sketch a Brief Outline. This breaks down the key points or sections of your presentation.

Once you have completed your request, tag me @paulbratslavsky and I will review your proposal and reach out with next step.

-->


Thank you.
